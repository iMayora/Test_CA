# Condor Agency Data Analyst Interview Test

Welcome to my submission repository for the Data Analyst position at Condor Agency. This repository contains my solutions for the SQL test and the Python script assignment as part of the interview process.

## About the Test

This repository is structured into two main sections:
1. **SQL Test**: A series of SQL queries and database tasks showcasing my ability to manipulate and analyze data.
2. **Python Script**: A Python script developed to perform specific data analysis tasks, demonstrating my coding skills and understanding of data processing.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For database querying and data manipulation tasks.
- **Python**: Utilized for scripting.

## Installation and Setup

No installation is required to view the SQL queries. However, to run the Python script, you will need:
- Python 3.11
- Relevant Python libraries: `pip install itertools`

## Repository Structure

- `/sql_test`: Contains all SQL queries to solve the challenge.
- `/python_script`: Includes the Python script and documentation in the README.md.

## Usage

- SQL files can be viewed directly or run in any SQL-compatible database environment.
- To run the Python script, navigate to the `/python_script` directory and run `python number_decoder.py`.
