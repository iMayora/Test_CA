# Vector Combination Finder

This Python script is designed to find valid combinations of a predefined numeric vector. It uses various rules and conditions to determine if a permutation of the vector elements constitutes a valid combination.

## Overview

The script includes a function to check if a number is prime, functions to validate certain prefixes and patterns within the vector, and a main function to find valid combinations. It's particularly focused on processing a vector with specific rules:

- The vector's prefix must match certain criteria.
- The vector must contain specific digits.
- Certain patterns and divisibility rules are checked.

## Functionality

- `is_prime(n)`: Checks if a number is prime.
- `valid_prefix(prefix)`: Validates if the prefix of the vector meets certain criteria.
- `valid_vector(v)`: Determines if a given permutation of the vector is valid based on multiple rules.
- `find_combinations(v)`: Iterates through permutations of the vector to find a valid combination.

## Customization

You can modify the `vector` variable in the script to test different combinations or change the rules within the `valid_vector` function to apply different criteria for validity.
